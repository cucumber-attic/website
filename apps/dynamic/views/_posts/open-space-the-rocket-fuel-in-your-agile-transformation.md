I absolutely love open space.

Over the last couple of years, we've been privilidged to be trusted by some of
our best [consulting clients](/training) to run open space events in their
organisations. I'm now convinved that these events are crucial in powering the
cultural shift to agile software development.

In this post I want give you a sense of what open space is like and share some 
practical advice about how to run your own open space event.

What is open space?
====================

Have you ever been to a conference, and discovered that your most enduring
memory was not in one of the timetabled sessions, but in the hallway *in
between* the sessions? You found yourself in a small group, all passionately
interested in the topic of your conversation; great insights were shared.

Open space is a meeting structure designed to deliberately harness this energy.
Using a few simple rules, a large group of people self-organises a dynamic,
evolving schedule that allows every individual to contibute and learn by
following their own enthusiasms and interests.

To give you a flavour, here’s a video produced by our friends at 
[Liberty IT](https://www.liberty-it.co.uk/) in Belfast, where we recently 
ran a two-day open-space for about 120 people:

The open space format works at almost any scale, from a dozen people meeting for a half-day 
through to an entire division of hundreds of people organising a multi-day off-site.

The rules
==========

The self-organisation of open space needs some boundaries to work. These are
often described as _five principles, and one law_. The five principles are:

-   **Whoever comes are the right people**. Whether you have 80 people at your
    session, or 8, don’t waste time wishing someone else was there. Those people
    are the people who care the most about this topic, so work with them. Even
    if you end up with nobody in your session, you’ll have some time to yourself
    to think about the topic and work on it without distraction.

-   **Whenever it starts is the right time**. Spirit and creativity do not run on
    the clock.

-   **Where you are is the right place**. Always be aware of what’s going on
    around you. Perhaps you meant to go to a session right now but you’re
    already in an interesting conversation where you are. Then stay where you
    are!

-   **When it’s over, it’s over**. Don’t feel forced stick to the timetable - if the
    conversation or session has reached a natural conclusion ahead of schedule,
    use the law of two feet (see below) and go find somewhere else to
    contribute.

-   **Whatever happens is the only thing that could have - prepare to be
    surprised**! Try not to fret about what might have been. Make the most of
    what’s happened, and expect that things will not go according to plan.

The law is known as **The law of two feet**

>   If at any time, you don't feel you're learning or contributing anything,
>   it's your responsibility to use your two feet to take you somewhere else
>   where you can.

As a facilitator, you need to emphasise this element of personal responsibility.
If each individual does their best to maximise their own learning and
contribution, the overall event is bound to be a success.

Tips for a facilitator
======================

Facilitating an open space can be a wonderful experience, but it does require
some careful preparation.

Although stating the rules is an important part of making an open-space event
work, there are a few other fundamental tips for a facilitator to be aware of to
make the event a success.

Do the pre-work
----------------

Before the event, prime the audience several times by email (or any other method
at hand) to get them ready for what to expect. Do this by:

-   Inviting people who wish to attend to make an 'application' by answering a series of
    topic-related questions.

-   Sending round information about the principles of open-space, and any quotes
    or other communications from previous events.

-   Sending round a [one-page session leader
    guide](http://agileforall.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/OpenSpaceSessionLeaderGuide.pdf)
    with encouragement to lead a session.

Use a theme
------------

Having an ambitious or provocative framing question such as _"How can we make
continuous delivery a reality in our organisation by 2018?"_ helps people
beforehand when thinking about proposing sessions, and also helps to keep the
session topics somewhat coherent.

People will always have their off-topic axes to grind and that's fine (after
all, whoever comes are the right people) but having a stated theme will help to
focus most of the sessions around that topic.

Do your research beforehand to choose a theme that seems to be the most
pressing one for the group you want to work with. Use the theme in your
pre-work.

Create a sense of safety
-------------------------

The magic that makes an open space event work is when people there feel
psychologically safe to speak their minds and follow their hears about where
they can offer the most meaningful contribution.

Many people do not start out their typical working day feeling in such a
relaxed and open frame of mind. So it's up to the facilitator to engender this
feeling in the attendees.

But how?

Start by explicitly stating that you want people to feel safe. Tell them that they can
leave their roles at the door, and that everyone here is an equal. 

Warming the group up by doing an exercise to connect them with one another,
perhaps doing a playful activity like drawing, can help.

You could create an anonymous suggestion box (a pile of index cards and a
cardboard box with a hole in it would do) where people can tell you what you
can do to make them feel more relaxed. Often just making this offer will help
people to feel more relaxed, even if they never take you up on it.

If you're seriously concerned that psychological safety may be an issue,
you could consider asking managers or senior executives to exclude themselves from your first 
event. Ultimately, open space events can be a great way to build trust between
these groups, but you may want to build up to that gradudally.

Warm up
--------

As the facilitator, try to start the event off by getting people on their feet
and doing something connected with the purpose of the event that will get them
talking.

I often use [Sharon Bowman](http://bowperson.com/)'s "sole mates" (find the
person in the room with the shoes most like yours) but you can insert any good
game here that gets people into groups of two-to-three, and ask them to share
one expectation or hope for the event, or some other topic-related question.

Agenda Building
---------------

At an open-space, the agenda is built by the participants themselves. This is
obviously a crucial part of the event. Make sure you have plenty of paper and
pens, and ask everyone who wants to lead a session to write up a card or
post-it with at least the:

- Session title
- Intended audience / pre-requisites
- Session leader name

Then ask them to queue up and present a 30-second pitch to the rest of the
group, before placing their card on the agenda board in a particular time and
place.

Work with the space
--------------------

Another magic ingredient in open-spaces is the spaces themselves. The diverse
character of the individual spaces can attract and encourage different kinds of
interaction, so make the most of the different strengths and weaknesses of each
one. Some will have a screen and be great for presentations or coding
exercises, some will be more suited to a discussion. Make the attributes of
each space clear on your agenda board, and try to help people post their
sessions in the appropriate space. Look for unofficial spaces in corridors that
could be used for smaller discussion tracks.

Let go
------

In [Harrison Owen's classic book on open space](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Open-Space-Technology-Agency-Distributed/dp/1576754766), he says:

> To the best of my knowledge, there is exactly one way to absolutely guarantee the failure of an open space event, and that is to try and control it.

Be aware that you will have your own expectations for the event. Try to put your mind at ease and remember _whatever happens is the only thing that could have_.

Closing circle
--------------

At the end of the day, make sure to get everyone back in a circle and give them
a chance to share what they’ve experienced. Many people will feel they’ve missed
out on a lot of the conversations (you may have had at least 3-4 going on in
parallel all day) so this is their chance to come back together and share those
different experiences. Make the most of that.

As the facilitator, you can try to use the [focussed
conversation](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Focused-Conversation-Access-Workplace-x/dp/0865714169)
method to guide the closing circle towards actions. I like to ask every
individual to write down one action on a card, and take it away with them.

Attend another open space
-------------------------

Open space is much easier to understand through experience than by reading
these words. The agile community organise lots of these events, such as
[CITCON](http://citconf.com/), [Agile Coach
Camp](http://agilecoachcamp.org/tiki-index.php) and our very own
[CukenSpace](http://cukenfest.cucumber.io) coming next month.

I encourage you to attend one of these events and experience open space for
yourself. I can guarantee it'll be a memorable experience.

Of course, if you would like an experienced faciliator to run an event for you,
we'd be [happy to help](https://cucumber.typeform.com/to/gUEP2E?).
