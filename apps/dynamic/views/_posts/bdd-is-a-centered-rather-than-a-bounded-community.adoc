Dan North mentioned at one point in the CukeUp 2015 panel yesterday the notion
in theology of a community being a "bounded set." Since Tom Stuart had been
gracious enough to invite me to participate in the panel, towards the end of the
session I joined the panel so I could expand on Dan's comment. I pointed out
that the same theology also talks about the notion of a community being a
"centered set." To me, this is what BDD really is: A centered set, rather than a
bounded set. In other words, _BDD is a centered community, rather than a bounded
community._

I want to be clear what I meant by bounded vs. centered set as it applies to a
community when I proposed it in the CukeUp 2015 panel. These terms originated in
a theological context with the writings of anthropologist and missiologist Paul
Hiebert, in terms of what makes a person a Christian. I'm going to quote and
adapt a significant amount of the content from his original article in what
follows to make it relevant for those without a background or interest in
theology. Before I do that though, first a little background is in order.

== CukeUp 2015

The CukeUp 2015 conference at Skills Matter in London culminated yesterday in an
wonderful panel discussion about what BDD actually is, organized and facilitated
by Tom Stuart. I highly recommend anyone interested in current thinking in BDD watch
the video posted by Skills Matter at https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/6174-wtf-is-bdd.

It seemed clear to me from the sentiments expressed in the session that focusing
on boundaries and exclusion is not what the BDD community has ever been about.
BDD is a community with values and principles at the center that promotes a
certain growing body of knowledge and cloud of practices.

But there is no interest the BDD community in adopting a bounded set approach,
and staying static by "locking down" the body of knowledge or cloud of practices
that currently makes up BDD. Rather, the BDD community wants, and needs, to
continue challenging the status quo and incorporating new learning and practices
as they reveal themselves in the future.

== Bounded sets

In his 1978 articlefootnote:[Paul Hiebert, "Conversion, Culture and Cognitive Categories." In: Gospel in Context 1:4 (October, 1978), 24-29., sourced from https://danutm.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/hiebert-paul-g-conversion-culture-and-cognitive-categories.pdf, 3/28/2015
]
, Hiebert notes that many of our words refer to bounded sets:
"apples," "oranges," "pencils," and "pens," for instance. What is a bounded set?
How does our mind form it? In creating a bounded set our mind puts together
things that share some common characteristics. "Apples," for example, are objects
that are "the firm fleshy somewhat round fruit of a Rosaceous tree. They are
usually red, yellow or green and are eaten raw or cooked."

Bounded sets have certain structural characteristics — that is, they force us to
look at things in a certain way. Let us use the category "apples" to illustrate
some of these:

a. _The category is created by listing the essential characteristics that an
object must have to be within the set._ For example, an apple is (1) a kind of
"fruit" that is (2) firm, (3) fleshy, (4) somewhat round, and so on. Any fruit
that meets these requirements (assuming we have an adequate definition) is an
"apple."
b. _The category is defined by a clear boundary._ A fruit is either an apple or it
is not. It cannot be 70% apple and 30% pear. Most of the effort in defining the
category is spent on defining and maintaining the boundary. In other words, not
only must we say what an "apple" is, we must also clearly differentiate it from
"oranges," "pears," and other similar objects that are _not_ "apples."
c. _Objects within a bounded set are uniform in their essential characteristics._
All apples are 100% apple. One is not more apple than another. Either a fruit is
an apple or it is not. There may be different sizes, shapes, and varieties, but
they are all the same in that they are all apples. There is no variation
implicit within the structuring of the category.
d. _Bounded sets are static sets._ If a fruit is an apple, it remains an apple
whether it is green, ripe, or rotten. The only change occurs when an apple
ceases to be an apple (e.g., being eaten), or when something like an orange is
turned into an apple (something we cannot do). The big question, therefore, is
whether an object is inside or outside the category. Once it is within, there
can be no change in its categorical status.

== What if BDD was a Bounded Set?

What happens to our concept of "BDD" if we define it in terms of a bounded set?
If we use the above characteristics of a bounded set we probably come up with
something like the following:

a. _We would define "BDD" in terms of a set of essential or definitive
characteristics._ These characteristics, such as perhaps collaborative
specification by example, test-first automation, feature injection,
red-green-refactor (TDD), would be non-negotiable for people doing BDD.
b. _We would make a clear distinction between what is "BDD" and what is not._
There is no place in between. Moreover, maintaining this boundary would be critical to
the maintenance of the category of BDD. Therefore it would be essential we determine who
is doing BDD and who is not, and to keep the two sharply differentiated. We would want
to make sure to include those who
are truly doing BDD and to exclude from the community those who claim to be but are
not. If BDD was to be a bounded set, to have an unclear boundary would be to undermine the very concept of BDD
itself.
c. _We would view all "BDD practitioners" as essentially the same._ There would be
experienced BDD practitioners and beginners, but all are doing BDD, since they are
within the boundary. Homogeneity within the community in terms of belief and practices
would be the norm and the goal.

If we think of BDD as a bounded set, we must decide what are the definitive
characteristics that set a BDD practitioner apart from a non-BDD practitioner.
We may do so in terms of belief in certain essential "truths" about BDD, or
strict adherence to certain essential BDD "practices."

BDD, as understood by leaders within the community, is clearly NOT a bounded
set. Rather, it is a centered set. Let's see what we mean by that.

== Centered Sets

There are other ways to form mental categories. Hiebert says a second way is to
form centered setsfootnote:[There are also Fuzzy Sets, see Hiebert's article for
more references]. A centered set has the following characteristics:

a. _It is created by defining a center, and the relationship of things to that center._
Some things may be far from the center, but they are moving towards the
center, therefore, they are part of the centered set. On the other hand, some
objects may be near the center but are moving away from it, so they are not a
part of the set. The set is made up of all objects moving towards the center.

b. _While the centered set does not place the primary focus on the boundary,
there is a clear division between things moving in and those moving out._ An
object either belongs to a set or it does not. The set focuses upon the center
and the boundary emerges when the center and the movement of the objects has
been defined. There is no great need to maintain the boundary in order to
maintain the set. The boundary is not the focus so long as the center is clear.

c. _Centered sets reflect variation within a category._ While there is a clear
distinction between things moving in and those moving out, the objects within
the set are not categorically uniform. Some may be near the center and others
far from it, even though all are moving towards the center. Each object must be
considered individually. It is not reduced to a single common uniformity within
the category.

d. _Centered sets are dynamic sets._ Two types of movements are essential parts of
their structure. First, it is possible to change direction — to turn from moving
away to moving towards the center, from being outside to being inside the set.
Second, because all objects are seen in constant motion, they are moving, fast
or slowly, towards or away from the center. Something is always happening to an
object. It is never static.

Illustrations of centered sets are harder to come by in English, since English tends
to see the world largely in terms of bounded sets. One example is a magnetic field
in which particles are in motion. Electrons are those particles which are drawn
towards the positive magnetic pole, and protons are those attracted by the negative
pole. The diagram here is another way of visualizing a centered setfootnote:[Sourced from http://www.academia.edu/6810466/Understanding_Christian_Identity_in_Terms_of_Bounded_and_Centered_Set_Theory_in_the_Writings_of_Paul_G._Hiebert[academia.edu]].


== BDD as a Centered Set

In contrast to a bounded set, how does the concept "BDD" look defined as a
centered set as I propose?

a. _A BDD practitioner is be defined in terms of the center — in terms of the
principles, values and goals that the BDD community holds to be central_. These
principles, values and goals were enumerated quite clearly by Dan North and
others during the panel session and are spelled out in other places (Dan's original
article about BDD in Better Software was published in 2006 and still applies today). From the
nature of the centered set, it should be clear that it is possible that there
are those near the center who know a great deal about BDD, but who are moving
away from the center. On the other hand there are those who are at a distance —
who know little about BDD because they are just starting to learn it — but they
are still BDD practitioners.
b. _There is a clear division between being doing BDD and not doing BDD._
The boundary is there. To pick an extreme example, I mentioned on the panel that a team doing waterfall
(serial lifecycle phase gate) development with no collaboration between roles, not
using examples, and doing no test automation at all could not be said to be doing BDD.
But with a centered set there is less stress on maintaining the
boundary in order to preserve the existence and purity of the category, the BDD
community. There is also no need to play boundary games and institutionally
exclude those who are not truly part of the BDD community. Rather, the focus is on the center
and of pointing people to that center. Inclusion, rather than exclusion, is
the name of the BDD game.
c. _There is a recognition of variation among the BDD community._ Some are
closer to the BDD values in their knowledge and practice, others have only a
little knowledge and need to grow. But - whether novice or expert or somewhere
in between - all are doing BDD, and are called to continuously seek to
improve and grow in their understanding and practice of delivering value early
and often.

Being a centered set, growth thus is an essential part of practicing BDD. When a
team begins doing BDD, they begin a journey and should strive to continue to
move towards the center. There is no static state. Learning BDD is not the end,
it is the beginning. We need good BDD education, mentoring and coaching to teach
BDD to the many beginners who will join the community in the years to come, but
we must also think about the need to continously improve and inspire novices to
move beyond following recipes and so-called "best practices" and experiment with
tailoring BDD to their unique context.

I submit that the agile community in general should also be considered a
centered set, with the agile manifesto as the central value statement for the
movement. Whether BDD, or agile in general, being a centered community rather
than a bounded one must involve always seeking to not only uphold but also
increase the gravitational pull of the values at the center.
