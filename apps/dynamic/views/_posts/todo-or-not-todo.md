title: "TODO or not TODO"

Like a lot of teams we've gone back and forth on leaving [`TODO`
comments][todo-comments] in the code.  Are they [useful][todo-useful] or
[harmful][todo-harmful]. On the one hand we appreciated being able to quickly
mark something as needing attention without giving it focus now and distracting
us from what we were currently trying to do.  On the other hand we felt bad when
we came across lots of `TODO`s in the code that weren't getting fixed &mdash;
the [broken windows][broken-windows] in our codebase.

We used to rely quite heavily on [feature branches][feature-branch] and would
merge new code back to master when it was complete so we tried a rule of no
`TODO`s on master. This worked reasonably well. It allowed us to liberally add
`TODO`s while we were working on something new and forced us to make sure we'd
dealt with them before merging. If you are using feature branches I think this
is a good strategy.

We really started to notice the problem with `TODO`s not being cleaned up as we
moved to a [trunk-based development][trunk-based] process. We were always
committing straight to master so there wasn't a regular checkpoint that made us
keep our `TODO`s under control.

We noticed this problem during one of our retrospectives and someone suggested
that it would be great if we could have a way of scoring the codebase based on
the number of `TODO`s and fail the build if we went over a threshold.

This is where [Aslak][aslak] stepped up and gave us [`bumbailiff`][bumbailiff] &mdash;
a script that finds the TODOs in your code and uses Git to age them in
TODO-days. Too many TODO-days and it fails.

We run `bumbailiff` in a [Git pre-push hook][pre-push]. We get constant feedback
about the things we have said we want to do and how long ago we said them. When
we hit the threshold, we're prevented from pushing new code until we've dealt
with at least some of the TODOs.

Dealing with TODOs is when things get interesting. Some of the TODOs are things
we should [JFDI][jfdi] &mdash; like a rename refactoring. Others take some more
work, and we have to make a decision if its something we do now, or whether we
need to add a technical story to the backlog so we can prioritise it. Sometimes
its really a new feature, and it should definitely go on the backlog. The
important thing is that we have to consider the TODO and make a decision.

Except... sometimes we need to keep moving, sometimes it isn't the right time to
focus on those TODOs. In those cases we get commits raising the `bumbailiff`
threshold &mdash [extending the loan][technical-debt] and keep the `bumbailiff`
at bay.
