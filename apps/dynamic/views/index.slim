            mind at all times.

              domain, and collaborate to produce concrete examples that describe
              the behaviour they want.

          p
            | As the team work on the solution, Cucumber tells you which examples
              are implemented and working, and warns you about the ones that aren’t.
          p
            | Before you know it, you have one document that’s both the specification
              and the tests for your software.
