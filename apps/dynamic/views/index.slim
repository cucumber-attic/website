            closer collaboration, helping teams keep the business goal in
            mind at all times.

            | First, the developers, testers and business folks explore the problem
              domain, and collaborate to produce concrete examples that describe
              the behaviour they want.
          p
            | Sometimes that discussion is hard, because it throws up all the
              misunderstandings and assumptions you’d normally discover
              much later on.

              acceptance tests.
          p
            | As the team work on the solution, Cucumber tells you which examples
              are implemented and working, and warns you about the ones that aren’t.
          p
            | Before you know it, you have one document that’s both the specification
              and the tests for your software.
