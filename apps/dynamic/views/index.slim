            | Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text. The text is written in a
            a<> href="http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BusinessReadableDSL.html"  business-readable domain-specific language
            | and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format.

        | Cucumber is Aslak Hellesøy's rewrite of RSpec's "Story runner", which was originally written by Dan North. (Which again was a rewrite of his first implementation - RBehave. RBehave was his Ruby port of JBehave). Early versions of the RSpec "Story Runner"
          required that stories be written in Ruby. Seeing how much this sucked David Chelimsky added

        | In April 2008, Aslak Hellesøy started the Cucumber project to address the internal design flaws and usability problems of the RSpec Story Runner (Yes - Cucumber also has warts on the inside).

          p If your organisation is only using Cucumber for test automation, this training will equip you with the skills you need to start using it for executable specifications and living documentation as well.
