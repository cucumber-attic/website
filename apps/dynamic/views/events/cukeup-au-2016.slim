      h1 Why?
      figure
        img src="/images/cukeup/icons/cup.png" alt=""
      p CukeUp is small and friendly. You'll be inspired by great speakers one minute, then sitting next to them in a fun, hands-on workshop the next.
      p We work hard to create a great atmosphere where ideas and curiousity run free.

      h1 What?

      p A conference in Sydney for people who care about building better software:
      p CukeUp! brings together people and ideas to educate and inspire one another.

      h1 How?
      figure
        img src="/images/cukeup/icons/cucumber-slices.png" alt=""
      p Each day has a beginning, a middle, and an end. People learn in different ways, so we mix things up, with 90-minute workshops sandwiched in-between punchy 25-minute talks.
      p You're never bored.

    h2 Behaviour-Driven Development

    p BDD is a set of practices that enables teams to produce more valuable software with fewer bugs. It helps communicate requirements with more precision, discover defects early and produce software that remains maintainable over time.

    p CukeUp is a conference for anyone who wants to get better at BDD.

        p If you want to really get to grips with BDD, pick up ideas to improve collaboration in your delivery team, and not just automate your tests, then get yourself to CukeUp! — Nick Pass, Sydney 2015

    figure.quote
      blockquote
        p I  expected a typical  tech conference, but CukeUp was so  much better than that. I found a really welcoming, open minded group representing a range of disciplines, and really practical talks and workshops, with a real focus on the social aspects of collaborating to produce better software - Josh Crompton, Sydney 2015

    figure.quote
      blockquote
        p It’s just a real mixture. It’s not just exclusive to Cucumber, which it could easily be. Instead it really embraces all of the other stuff around, and there’s no attempt at all to to push the direction down a certain path towards Cucumber stuff; in fact challenge and healthy debate seems to be really welcomed which is a really nice thing - Jenny Martin, London 2015

    h1 Previous Years
    p In the 5 years that CukeUp has been running in London and NYC, we've had a diverse group of speakers and attendees: <strong>Product owners, business analysts, testers and programmers</strong>. You are all fundamental to making BDD work, and our programme reflects that.

    p Here are some of our favourite talks from previous years.
