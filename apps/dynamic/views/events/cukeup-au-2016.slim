              .speaker Seb Rose
              .synopsis
                p Behaviour-Driven Development has dramatically changed the way many organisations deliver software. Tools like Cucumber and techniques like Example Mapping are strengthening ties between IT and business, resulting in more predictable and maintainable software with less bugs. In this short introduction, Seb Rose - author of The Cucumber Book and founder of Cucumber Ltd - will outline the fundamentals of BDD, and how your business can benefit.

			        | How to create your career while building better software. 
			        .speaker Shirley Tricker
			        .synopsis
			          p If you're attending this conference, you care about building better software - you're willing to challenge the way that things are done and to try new ways of working.
                p But do you do the same for your career? This talk is not about software, it's all about you and how to be valuable and employable. It's about how to feel in control of your options and confident about navigating the new ways of working."

        p The quality of speakers, atmosphere, and the split between practical and presentation is fantastic. If you want to really get to grips with BDD, pick up ideas to improve collaboration in your delivery team, and not just automate your tests, then get yourself to CukeUp! — Nick Pass, Sydney 2015

      blockquote
        p I  expected a typical  tech conference, but CukeUp was so much more than that. I found a really welcoming, open minded group representing a range of disciplines, and really practical talks and workshops, with a real focus on the social aspects of collaborating to produce better software - Josh Crompton, Sydney 2015

        p It’s just a real mixture of topics. It really embraces Behaviour-Driven Development and all of the other stuff around, but there’s no attempt to push you down a certain path; in fact challenging the status quo and healthy debate is welcomed which is a really nice thing - Jenny Martin, London 2015
