          | Hundreds of teams are benefiting from the techniques and expert advice we give in our Behaviour-Driven Development training. We work with companies who truly understand the commitment needed to deliver certain, coherent software. Our customers are in nestled various industries, from Fortune 500 companies to high-growth start-ups.

            | Without a doubt, our team has greatly benefited. I have been in IT
              for 13 years and have attended training classes on various subjects
              during my career. This was by far the most useful training I have ever attended.

            | We had been using Cucumber for about 3 years and had made some great progress, but we also struggled in some areas. We needed some help to ensure we had the right focus going forward. Our main focus was at automated testing, but I didn't feel we were getting the real gains of BDD by focussing on conversations and The Three Amigos approach. It's hard to estimate how much our savings have been, but it probably runs into £100,000’s per year. Being trained by the team who developed Cucumber gave the team a real lift. Aslak was a great trainer.

            | Before the course, we knew we wanted a better understanding of how to write acceptance tests more efficiently. The approach of Make the test fail, Make the test pass, Refactor, has been a great learning curve for us; something we are now incorporating into our everyday tests. It was also clear we had to sharpen our soft skills; don’t just send your developers and QAs, invite your business teams too. We’ve taken a lot from the visit, I would absolutely recommend this course.

            | I know we have saved money over the past year as a direct result of our consultation. We are much better at planning, which means we are more efficient developers, and spend a lot less time on missed requirements, bug fixes, and rework. We are churning out new features and products faster than ever, bringing value to our customers sooner and reaping the rewards therein. If I had to put a figure on it, I would say we have saved and/or earned $20k - $40k over the past year as a result of the knowledge we gained from our consultation.

            | We knew we had to change our current processes and get closer to a BDD mindset. I will certainly write the examples earlier and with more people involved. I'd definitely recommend this course. It not only tells you about the theory but also how to use the new knowledge in your projects.
